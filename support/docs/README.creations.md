Summary
-------
I thought the idea of a unique spacesuit was cool, but wasn't overly enamored with the looks of the default Mantis Armor. I also didn't really want to literally have Mandalorian armor. So I compromised, and retextured the Shock Trooper Armor, Starborn Helmet, and Deepseeker Pack instead. This is the result.

This is a limited version of the README. The full version can be found at the mod's GitHub repository (https://github.com/rux616/starfield-mantisorian-armor).

Compatibility
-------------
Should be mostly compatible with pretty much everything, even mods that alter the stats of the Mantis spacesuit. With that being said, if another mod alters the file paths of the suit models, that will break this mod.

Known Issues
------------
- The spacesuit clips a little into the helmet around the neck area.
- Some of the detail textures from the original Mantis spacesuit show up on the replacement suit, resulting in some interesting patterning.
