[size=5][b]Overview[/b][/size]

[size=4][b][u]Summary:[/u][/b][/size]
I thought the idea of a unique spacesuit was cool, but wasn't overly enamored with the looks of the default Mantis Armor. I also didn't really want to literally have Mandalorian armor. So I compromised, and retextured the Shock Trooper Armor, Starborn Helmet, and Deepseeker Pack instead. This is the result.

The layered texture files in (paint.net format - pdn) can be found in the [url=https://github.com/rux616/starfield-mantisorian-armor]GitHub repository for this project[/url].

[size=4][b][u]Installation:[/u][/b][/size]
Modding is a bit different in Starfield, so I'm just going to say this: Use a mod manager. I am not going to support other install methods.
- Mod Organizer 2 v2.5.0 Beta 14 or later ([url=https://discord.gg/AKE9wRGpy4]MO2 Discord server[/url], "dev-builds" channel)
- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1]Vortex[/url]

[size=4][b][u]Known Issues:[/u][/b][/size]
- The spacesuit clips a little into the helmet around the neck area.
- Some of the detail textures from the original Mantis spacesuit show up on the replacement suit, resulting in some interesting patterning.
