Overview
========

Summary
-------
I thought the idea of a unique spacesuit was cool, but wasn't overly enamored with the looks of the default Mantis Armor. I also didn't really want to literally have Mandalorian armor. So I compromised, and retextured the Shock Trooper Armor, Starborn Helmet, and Deepseeker Pack instead. This is the result.

The layered texture files in (paint.net format - pdn) can be found in the GitHub repository for this project (https://github.com/rux616/starfield-mantisorian-armor).

Installation
------------
Modding is a bit different in Starfield, so I'm just going to say this: Use a mod manager. I am not going to support other install methods.
- Mod Organizer 2 v2.5.0 Beta 14 or later (MO2 Discord server (https://discord.gg/AKE9wRGpy4), "dev-builds" channel)
- Vortex (https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1)

Known Issues
------------
- The spacesuit clips a little into the helmet around the neck area.
- Some of the detail textures from the original Mantis spacesuit show up on the replacement suit, resulting in some interesting patterning.
